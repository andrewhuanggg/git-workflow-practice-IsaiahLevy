## Takeaways
<p> I believe that this article is an important read because it emphasizes two important ideas within the tech industry. 
For one, it brings light to the obvious- that there is a mass "layoff" of employees throughout the tech industry. The article points out that more than 70,000 employees at U.S.-based tech companies have lost their jobs in mass job cuts over the past 12 months. However, while this number is frightening, there is still positive news. 
<p>
<p>  According to the article, experts suggest that fears about the tech industry are over blown and, infact, software talent is still despretly needed across many 
industry's. Further, software engineers seem to be switching their paramaters in their job searches in favor of smaller companies which can be great for the economy! </p>
## Comment from Andrew Huang(alh8007)
<p>In fact, this can even be looked at in a positive way. Often times, people only talk about applying to big tech giants, such as Amazon, Meta, Google, etc. However, there are many tech jobs in non-tech industries such as healthcare, automotive, or education. While these jobs might not seem as prestigious as working at a FAANG company, many of them still offer competitive pay and good work life balance.</p>
